<br /><br />

## Visiting Researcher at Polytechnique Montreal

- **Efficient Neural Networks**: Design efficient neural network architectures based on binary neural networks and quantization to reduce the matmul operations in neural network under the supervision of Prof. [Jean Pierre David](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yVubPz4AAAAJ&hl=en).

## Data Scientist II at Woven by Toyota

- **Scene Tags Classification**: Design and develop a production model for the classification of scenes for a wide variety of scenarios based on weather, road type, parking, road structures, traffic conditions, intersections, and so on with macro-f1: 0.65 and micro-f1:0.75 for around 100 classes.

- **Few-shot object detection**: Design and develop a few-shot object detection method based on CenterNet architecture to improve the performance of the production model on long-tail distribution objects such as ambulances, bikes, and kickboards based on the images of fish-eye lens cameras.
 
- **Road Marking Recognition**: Developed a production model trained on Japanese/English text images to predict paint on streets/roads for self-driving vehicles using the backbone of the CRNN text recognition model with 99% word accuracy and ~0.2 msec latency on a synthetic dataset.

## Computer Vision Researcher at Rakuten (RIT)

- **Continuous Taxonomy Learning**: Develop a lifelong continual learning system for change in the hierarchy of images over time by utilizing recurrent neural networks, GCN, and lifelong learning methods based on hierarchical classification loss functions while baselining the results on Open Images v6 dataset.

- **Contextual Multi-Armed Bandits**: Develop a contextual bandit model to optimize Ad banners on Rakuten e-commerce website for tens of millions of users based on users’ historical purchase data and historical interactions with banners. Write production code to be used in real-time low latency application and performed thorough testing.

- **Anomaly Detection in Security**: Develop a user and entity analysis (UEBA) tool using clustering and multi-modal (CNN & LSTM) learning to detect malware and anomalies in tens of thousands of Rakuten employee’s terminals from network text logs.

- **Credit Scoring**: Increased the approval rate of credit card merchant customers by 5% by developing a credibility scoring model and segmentation of merchants that led to an increase in revenue of millions of dollars. Lead a team of engineers for the backend development and design different system architecture diagrams.

- **Market Trading**: Gained more than 7% ROI / year in daily trading of products such as forex currency pairs, bonds, and indexes by developing end-to-end machine learning models (LSTM & Traditional ML) based on historical market macroeconomics data for assets under management (AUM) of tens of millions of dollars.
